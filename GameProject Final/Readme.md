My FINAL project for the Introduction to Programming I module.
It does not use proper object oriented programming and abstraction, however, it was an important project to gain a better understanding of objects, constructor functions, etc.

The game can be tested live following [this link](/https://alexst14.github.io/minero/)

The game is feature rich, including a basic UI system, powers, stamina, etc.
