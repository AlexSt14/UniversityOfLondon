Projects while studying at University of London in year 1 <br>
Through many other small projects or algorithms such as search or sort algorithms, this repository contains 3 major projects done during my studies:

- Introduction to Programming I --> [Browser game as a final project for the module](https://github.com/AlexSt14/UniversityOfLondon_Year1/tree/main/GameProject%20Final)
Similar to a Mario game, it was developed using vanilla javascript alongside p5.js.
Run it locally and start playing. It includes enemies, obstacles, and powers.
- Introduction to Programming II --> [Browser drawing app including multiple tools](https://github.com/AlexSt14/UniversityOfLondon_Year1/tree/main/draw-app-masterV2)
A stripped-down version of Paint in the browser. It was developed using vanilla javascript for the most part.
It includes a handful of tools which can be used to draw or create.
- Web Development --> Full vanilla HTML/CSS/Javascript + Bootstrap [Website for local organisation](https://github.com/AlexSt14/UniversityOfLondon_Year1/tree/main/Make-up%20%26%20Beauty%20Saloon)
Final project for Web Development module. It is a website that was created for a local business.
It was developed using vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript, alongside Bootstrap.
Communication with stakeholders during this development was important.
