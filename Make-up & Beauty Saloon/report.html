        <h1>Daniel Alex Sthali</h1>
        <h2>Report</h2>
        <h3>Introduction: </h3>
        <p>
            In the initial stages of development, I engaged in an in-depth conversation with the business owner to understand their vision and objectives. This collaborative process was crucial in ensuring that the website not only met their functional requirements but also 
            resonated with their brand identity. The lack of a clear layout direction from the client presented an opportunity for me to exercise creative leadership, resulting in the production of several layout prototypes from which the final design was selected.
        </p>
        <p>
            The website's structure is intuitive and user-centric, comprising five main pages: Home, About, Services, Contact, and Portfolio. Each page serves a distinct purpose and collectively they create a cohesive online presence. The Home page acts as a gateway, offering 
            a snapshot of what visitors can expect while inviting them to explore deeper into the site. It sets the tone with a welcoming message and provides immediate access to the other sections.
        </p>
        <p>
            The About page delves into the makeup artist's background, shedding light on their journey, qualifications, and the unique approach they bring to their craft. This personal touch helps build trust and rapport with potential clients.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Services page is designed to inform and entice. It details the range of offerings and their price, from everyday makeup to bridal looks, and eyebrow services, ensuring that clients can easily find the service that suits their needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the Contact page, visitors are presented with various methods to reach out to the business, facilitating easy communication and booking.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Portfolio page is a visual testament to the artist's work, displaying a gallery of images that showcase the breadth and quality of their skills, serving as a powerful tool for attracting new clients.
        </p>
        <p>
            Visually, the site adopts a modern aesthetic, blending warm hues with dark grey to create an inviting and professional atmosphere. The color scheme was chosen to evoke the elegance and warmth that the makeup artist brings to their work. Bootstrap was employed for 
            its responsive design capabilities, but it has been heavily customized to align with the unique brand and functional needs of the client.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, the website is more than a digital brochure; it's an extension of the makeup artist's studio, a place where artistry meets accessibility, and where potential clients can embark on a journey towards their own transformation.

        <h3>Inspiration:</h3>
        <p>I was inspired by the make up artist itself while discussing the needs of the client and explaining me what and how would they want it. I also got inspiration from other websites that were created for make up artists, lastly I was inspired 
            by different artists around the web. To summarize, I have been inspired by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Talking to the makeup artist about what they wanted. Hearing directly from my client helped me understand their needs and preferences. This conversation was important for shaping the website design.</li>
                <li>Looking at other makeup artist websites. I researched designs and features from other sites in this industry. This gave me ideas for layouts, images, and content to include. I was able to see what works well and determine what I wanted to incorporate.</li>
                <li>Browsing art and design sites. I found inspiration from artistic websites showcasing graphic design, photography, and digital art. Even though these weren't makeup sites, I got ideas for visuals, color palettes, and aesthetics. The creativity on these sites sparked my imagination.</li>
            </ul>
    </section>

        <h3>Accessibility:</h3>
        <p>Ensuring that my website is accessible to everyone, including individuals with disabilities, was a fundamental consideration during its design. Here are three specific ways in which I have made the site accessible, along with a brief explanation of their significance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Focus Indication for Interactive Elements:</strong> I have implemented visible focus indicators for all interactive elements such as links, buttons, and form inputs. This is crucial for users who navigate with a keyboard or assistive technologies, as it allows them to clearly see which element 
                is currently selected. For instance, when a user tabs through the site, a distinct outline or color highlights the active element, aiding those with visual impairments or motor difficulties.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Proper Form Labeling:</strong> Correct labeling of form fields is essential for users who depend on screen readers to interact with online content. By associating each label with its respective input field, we ensure that the form is easy to understand and use. 
                For example, when a screen reader user focuses on a text input, the reader will announce the label so the user knows what information is being requested.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Keyboard-Only Navigation:</strong> The website can be navigated entirely using a keyboard, which is indispensable for users who cannot use a mouse. This includes the ability to traverse all pages and access all content, including the contact form. 
                Users can tab to different fields, make selections, and submit the form without needing to click with a mouse.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Usability:</h3>
        <p>As for usability, I considered the following ways on my website:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Semantic HTML:</strong> I prioritized the use of semantic HTML to create a logical and intuitive structure for the website. Semantic elements such as header, nav, section, article, and footer were employed to define the different parts of each page 
                clearly. This not only helps users understand the layout and navigate the content more easily but also assists search engines in indexing the site more effectively.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Alt Attributes and Error Handling:</strong> All images on the site include descriptive <code>alt</code> attributes, ensuring users who are visually impaired can understand the visual content through their screen readers. Additionally, 
                I implemented error messages for videos and other media that might fail to load, informing users of the issue and providing alternative content or instructions to access the information in another way.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Color Contrast:</strong> I carefully selected color schemes to ensure high contrast between text and background colors, following WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards. This consideration is particularly beneficial for users with visual impairments, 
                such as color blindness, ensuring that all users can read the content without strain. For instance, I avoided color combinations like green and red, which are commonly problematic for color differentiation, and instead chose colors that stand out clearly against their backgrounds.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Learning:</h3>
        <p>Creating this website was a valuable learning experience that required me to acquire new skills and deepen my understanding of web development. Here are three key areas where I expanded my knowledge:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>JavaScript Slideshow Implementation:</strong> The first challenge was implementing a slideshow feature using JavaScript. To tackle this, I began by searching for tutorials and examples on Google. I found several resources that explained the basics of creating a slideshow. 
                Through trial and error, I adapted the code snippets I found to fit the specific needs of my site. This process also involved debugging and refining the code, which is thoroughly documented in the website's code comments for transparency and future reference.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Responsive Design with @media Queries:</strong> The second skill I honed was using @media queries for responsive design, which I learned during the lessons of this module. I practiced writing different @media rules to ensure the website looked good and functioned 
                well on various devices, from desktops to smartphones. By experimenting with various breakpoints and CSS rules, I learned how to create a seamless user experience across different screen sizes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Understanding the Bootstrap Grid System:</strong> The most crucial learning curve was understanding how the Bootstrap grid system works. This was imperative for creating a responsive layout. I utilized the official Bootstrap documentation to learn about the grid 
                system's structure, including rows, columns, and responsive classes. This knowledge allowed me to construct a flexible and responsive design that adapts to the user's viewport. I spent time building sample layouts and adjusting grid configurations to see 
                their effects in real-time, which gave me a practical understanding of responsive design principles.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to these skills, I also familiarized myself with various other tools and resources, which I will detail in the resources section of this report. Each learning experience contributed significantly to the successful creation of the website and has increased my skill set as a web developer.</p>

        <h3>Evaluation 1:</h3>
        <p>I am particularly proud of the design aspects of the website, which I believe are on par with commercially successful websites. Here are some elements that I feel were especially successful:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Visual Design and Color Scheme:</strong> The website's aesthetic was carefully crafted to align with the makeup artist's brand identity. The use of a modern, clean design with a warm color palette creates an inviting and professional atmosphere. For example, the combination of 
                soft beige tones with accents of rose gold reflects the elegance and sophistication of the artist's work. This design choice was validated by the client, who expressed that the colors effectively conveyed the essence of their brand.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>User Experience and Flow:</strong> The layout of the website was structured to provide a smooth and intuitive user journey. The navigation is straightforward, allowing users to easily find information and services. The Home page serves as an engaging entry point that succinctly 
                previews the content found on other pages, encouraging users to explore further. The Services page is organized to clearly present the range of makeup services offered and eyebrows services, and the Portfolio page showcases the artist's work in a visually appealing grid layout. 
                The positive feedback from the client, particularly their enthusiasm for these pages, indicates that the flow and organization of the site meet their needs and expectations.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Client Feedback:</strong> The client's response to the website has been overwhelmingly positive. They were especially impressed with the Home, Services, and Portfolio pages, noting that the design exceeded their expectations. Their specific praise for these pages highlights 
                the effectiveness of the visual and structural choices made during the design process. The client's satisfaction is a testament to the success of the website in capturing their vision and presenting their services in the best possible light.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In summary, the combination of a well-thought-out design, user-friendly navigation, and alignment with the client's brand has resulted in a website that is not only visually appealing but also functional and effective in showcasing the makeup artist's services. The client's 
            approval serves as a strong indicator of the website's success.

        <h3>Evaluation 2:</h3>
        <p>Reflecting on the website, I recognize there are areas where enhancements could be made to further elevate the user experience. Here are some improvements I would consider:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Image Sizing Consistency:</strong> As noted, the varying image sizes on the Homepage and Portfolio page result in an undesirable gap above the footer. To address this, I plan to standardize the dimensions of the images. I will process each image to ensure they conform to a uniform 
                aspect ratio, which will create a more harmonious and aesthetically pleasing layout, eliminating any awkward spacing.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Loading Performance:</strong> In retrospect, optimizing the images for web use could also improve the site's loading times. I would consider implementing more aggressive image compression techniques or using modern image formats like WebP to enhance the site's performance, 
                especially on mobile devices where data usage and speed are crucial factors.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>User Feedback and Testing:</strong> While the client is satisfied with the design, gathering user feedback through usability testing could uncover insights into how real users interact with the site. In the future, I would allocate more time for user testing and make 
                iterative design changes based on the data collected. This could lead to refinements in the navigation, content layout, or interactive elements that might not be immediately apparent without user input.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <P>
            Looking ahead, I am committed to continuous learning and improvement. I believe that a website is never truly finished, it can always be refined and updated to better serve its users and reflect the latest web standards. By addressing these areas for improvement 
            and remaining open to feedback, I am confident that the website can evolve to provide an even more engaging and seamless experience for all visitors of the local make-up business.
        </P>
